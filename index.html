<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="images/me_300x400.jpg"/>
<p>
    My name is Evan Brill. I am a sophomore computer science/software engineering major at Rose-Hulman Institute of
    technology. My particular interests include C programming and binary exploitation in the ARM architecture.
    However, I have recently been branching out into other architectures and undertaking more complex projects. I also
    do a fair bit of high level development in languages like Java and Python as it is required for school. I occasionally
    use these languages to do work on my own projects or write silly things like Minecraft mods.
</p>
<p>
    I am also a member of the RHIT cross country and track and field teams. This takes up the vast majority of my time
    outside of class and schoolwork, but I really enjoy it so I am okay with that. In the rare times where I am not running
    or working on school, I like to spend my time outdoors. I do a fair bit of fishing, hiking, kayaking, biking, and camping,
    especially in the summers.
